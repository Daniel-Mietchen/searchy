# Intro

Notes on the source code of several example programs that might serve as basis for TopicTagger.

# JVFE`s TopicTagger

https://jvfe.github.io/wikidata_topictagger/

- Uses vue.js (maybe I should read a bit of Vue`s documentation)
- Uses vuetify too : https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/


Vuetify seems a bit more complicated to use than just vue. I'll have to study that too (instead of trying to rush).
For the moment, I'll try to make the TopicTagger without vue, vuetify and additional complications.
